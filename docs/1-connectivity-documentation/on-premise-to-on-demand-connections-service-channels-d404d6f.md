# On-Premise To On-Demand Connections \(Service Channels\)

Configure the number of physical connections for a Cloud Connector service channel.

Service channels let you configure the number of physical connections to the communication partner on cloud side, see [Using Service Channels](using-service-channels-16f6342.md). The default is 1. This value is used as well in versions prior to Cloud Connector 2.11, which did not offer a configuration option for each service channel. You should define the number of connections depending on the expected number of clients and, with lower priority, depending on the size of the exchanged messages.

If there is only a single RFC client for an S/4HANA Cloud channel or only a single HANA client for a HANA DB on SAP BTP side, increasing the number doesn't help, as each virtual connection is assigned to one physical connection. The following simple rule lets you to define the required number of connections per service channel:

-   Per 10 concurrent clients, use one physical connection.
-   If the transferred net data size is larger than 500k per request, make sure to add an additional connection per 2 of such clients.



## Example

For a HANA system in the SAP BTP, data is replicated using 18 concurrent clients in the on-premise network. In average, about 5 of those clients are regularly sending 600k. For the number of clients, you should use 2 physical connections, for the 5 clients sending larger amounts add an additional 3, which sums up to 5 connections.
