# Connectivity Proxy for Kubernetes

Use the connectivity proxy for Kubernetes to connect workloads on a Kubernetes cluster to on-premise systems.

The connectivity proxy is a Kubernetes component that connects workloads running on a Kubernetes cluster to on-premise systems, which are exposed via the [Cloud Connector](cloud-connector-e6c7616.md). The connectivity proxy must be paired to an SAP BTP region to grant access to the Cloud Connectors connected to that region. The SAP BTP domain model \(subaccounts\) is used to target a particular Cloud Connector.

The connectivity proxy is delivered as a Docker image and a Helm chart. You need to run the image on your Kubernetes cluster with appropriate configurations. The Helm chart simplifies the installation process. See [Lifecycle Management](lifecycle-management-60c0a45.md) for more details.

You can find information about new versions of the connectivity proxy via SAP BTP [release notes](https://help.sap.com/doc/43b304f99a8145809c78f292bfc0bc58/Cloud/en-US/98bf747111574187a7c76f8ced51cfeb.html?sel1=Connectivity).
