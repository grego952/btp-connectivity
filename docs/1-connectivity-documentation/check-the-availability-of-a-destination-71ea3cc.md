# Check the Availability of a Destination

How to check the availability of a destination in the *Destinations* editor \(SAP BTP cockpit\).



## Prerequisites

You have logged into the cockpit and opened the *Destinations* editor.



## Context

You can use the *Check Connection* button in the *Destinations* editor of the cockpit to verify if the `URL` configured for an HTTP Destination is reachable and if the connection to the specified system is possible.

> ### Note:  
> This check is available with *Cloud Connector version 2.7.1 or higher*.

For each destination, the check button is available in the destination detail view and in the destination overview list \(icon *Check availability of destination connection* in section *Actions*\).

> ### Note:  
> The check does not guarantee that the target system or service is operational. It only verifies if a connection is possible.

This check is supported for destinations with *<Proxy Type\>* `Internet` and `OnPremise`:

-   For `Internet` destinations:

    -   If the check receives an **HTTP status code above or equal to 500** from the targeted URL, the check is considered **failed**.
    -   Every **HTTP status code below 500** is treated as **successful**.

    > ### Restriction:  
    > The targeted URL cannot be a private endpoint \(for example, *localhost*\).


-   For `OnPremise` destinations:
    -   If the targeted backend is reached and returns an **HTTP status code below 500** the check is considered **successful**.
