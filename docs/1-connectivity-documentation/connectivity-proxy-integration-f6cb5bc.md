# Connectivity Proxy Integration

Integrate the transparent proxy with the connectivity proxy for Kubernetes.

The connectivity proxy is a Kubernetes component that connects workloads running on a Kubernetes cluster to on-premise systems exposed via the [Cloud Connector](cloud-connector-e6c7616.md). The transparent proxy itself doesn’t provide direct connections to on-premise systems, that is, the connectivity proxy integration is mandatory for the transparent proxy to route to on-premise destinations. To integrate the transparent proxy with the connectivity proxy, you must:

1.  Install a connectivity proxy instance or reuse an existing one. It must be installed in the same Kubernetes cluster where the transparent proxy is installed.

    For more information, see [Lifecycle Management](lifecycle-management-60c0a45.md).

2.  Follow the instructions under [Lifecycle Management](lifecycle-management-1c18e0c.md) and set up the `values.yaml` for integrating with the connectivity proxy, providing the `config.integration.connectivityProxy.serviceName`.

    For more information, see [Configuration Guide](configuration-guide-2a22cd7.md).

3.  If the connectivity proxy runs in multi-region mode, you can link a transparent proxy configuration for a Destination service instance with a connectivity proxy local region configuration. This can be done at design time by adding an association. Doing this, you won't need to provide the HTTP header `SAP-Connectivity-Region-Configuration-Id` on each request - the transparent proxy will automatically pass it to the connectivity proxy:

    ```
    config:
      integration:
        destinationService:
          instances:
          - name: <local-instance-name>
            serviceCredentials:
              secretKey: <secret-key>
              secretName: <secret-name>
              secretNamespace: <secret-namespace>
            associateWith:
              connectivityProxy:
                locallyConfiguredRegionId: <locally-configured-conn-proxy-region-id>
    ```
