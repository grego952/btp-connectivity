# Multitenancy in the Connectivity Service 

Using multitenancy for applications that require a connection to a remote service or on-premise application.



<a name="loio9c0bdd0efc8640739c9d2fa5cfe56cbd__top"/>

## Endpoint Configuration

Applications that require a connection to a remote service can use the Connectivity service to configure HTTP or RFC endpoints. In a provider-managed application, such an endpoint can either be once defined by the application provider \([Provider-Specific Destination](multitenancy-in-the-connectivity-service-9c0bdd0.md#loio9c0bdd0efc8640739c9d2fa5cfe56cbd__provider)\), or by each application subscriber \([Subscriber-Specific Destination](multitenancy-in-the-connectivity-service-9c0bdd0.md#loio9c0bdd0efc8640739c9d2fa5cfe56cbd__consumer)\).

If the application needs to use the same endpoint, independently from the current application subscriber, the destination that contains the endpoint configuration is uploaded by the application provider. If the endpoint should be different for each application subscriber, the destination can be uploaded by each particular application subscriber.

> ### Note:  
> This connectivity type is fully applicable also for on-demand to on-premise connectivity.

## Destination Levels

You can configure destinations simultaneously on two levels: *subaccount* and *service instance*. This means that it is possible to have one and the same destination on more than one configuration level. For more information, see [Managing Destinations](managing-destinations-84e45e0.md).

Destination lookup according to the level, when configured on:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Level

</th>
<th valign="top">

Lookup

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Subaccount level

</td>
<td valign="top">

Looked up on subaccount level, no matter which destination service instance is used.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Service instance level

</td>
<td valign="top">

Lookup via particular service instance \(in provider or subscriber subaccount associated with this service instance\).

</td>
</tr>
</table>

When the application accesses the destination at runtime, the Connectivity service does the following:

-   For a destination associated with a **provider** subaccount:
    1.  Checks if the destination is available on the *service instance* level. If there is no destination found, it
    2.  Searches the destination on *subaccount* level.


-   For a destination associated with a **subscriber** subaccount:
    1.  Checks if the destination is available on the *subscription* level. If there is no destination found, it
    2.  Searches the destination on *subaccount* level.
