# Destination Fragments

Destination fragments are objects used to override and extend destination properties through the Destination service REST API.

You can use destination fragments to override and/or extend destination properties as result of the “Find a destination” REST API request. Destination fragments are key-value based objects which contain a name and additional configurable properties.

</tr>
</table>

> ### Restriction:  
> The fragment must not contain the properties “Name” or “Type”.

Managing destination fragments for your application is supported only by the Destination service REST API. This API is documented in the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/scpconnectivity/rest).
