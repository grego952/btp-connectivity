# Server Certificate Authentication

Create and configure a *Server Certificate* destination for an application.



<a name="loioe75d7f15b808428e87ae70f494da0b42__section_N10017_N10011_N10001"/>

## Context

The server certificate validation is applicable to all destinations with proxy type `Internet` and `PrivateLink` that use the HTTPS protocol.

> ### Note:  
> TLS 1.2 became the default TLS version of HTTP destinations. If an HTTP destination is consumed by a java application the change will be effective after restart. All HTTP destinations that use the HTTPS protocol and have ProxyType=Internet can be affected. Previous TLS versions can be used by configuring an additional property TLSVersion=TLSv1.0 or TLSVersion=TLSv1.1.

## Properties

Property

Description

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

`TLSVersion` 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Optional property. Can be used to specify the preferred TLS version to be used by the current destination. Since TLS 1.2 is not enabled by default on the older java versions this property can be used to configure TLS 1.2 in case this is required by the server configured in this destination. It is usable only in HTTP destinations. Example: `TLSVersion`=`TLSv1.2` .

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

`TrustStoreLocation` 

1.  When used in local environment
2.  When used in cloud environment



</td>
<td valign="top">

Path to the keystore file which contains trusted certificates \(Certificate Authorities\) for authentication against a remote client.

To find the allowed keystore file formats, see [Use Destination Certificates](use-destination-certificates-df1bb55.md).

1.  The relative path to the keystore file. The root path is the server's location on the file system.
2.  The name of the keystore file.



> ### Note:  
> If the `TrustStoreLocation` property is not specified, the JDK trust store is used as a default trust store for the destination.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

`TrustStorePassword` 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Password for the JKS trust store file. This property is mandatory in case `TrustStoreLocation` is used.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

`TrustAll`

</td>
<td valign="top">

If this property is set to `TRUE` in the destination, the server certificate will not be checked for SSL connections. It is intended for test scenarios only, and should not be used in production \(since the SSL server certificate is not checked, the server is not authenticated\). The possible values are `TRUE` or `FALSE`; the default value is `FALSE` \(that is, if the property is not present at all\).

In case `TrustAll` = `TRUE`, the `TrustStoreLocation` property is ignored so you can omit it.

In case *<TrustAll\>* = `FALSE`, the *<TrustStoreLocation\>* property is mandatory to be used.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

`HostnameVerifier`

</td>
<td valign="top">

Optional property. It has two values: `Strict` and `BrowserCompatible`. This property specifies how the server hostname matches the names stored inside the server's X.509 certificate. This verifying process is only applied if TLS or SSL protocols are used and is not applied if the `TrustAll` property is specified. The default value \(used if no value is explicitly specified\) is `Strict`.

-   `Strict HostnameVerifier` works in the same way as Oracle Java 1.4, Oracle Java 5, and Oracle Java 6-rc. It is also similar to Microsoft Internet Explorer 6. This implementation appears to be compliant with RFC 2818 for dealing with wildcards. A wildcard such as "\*.foo.com" matches only subdomains at the same level, for example "a.foo.com". It does not match deeper subdomains such as "a.b.foo.com".

-   `BrowserCompatible HostnameVerifier` works in the same way as Curl and Mozilla Firefox. The hostname must match either the first common name \(CN\) or any of the subject-alts. A wildcard can occur in the CN and in any of the subject-alts.


The only difference between `BrowserCompatible` and `Strict` is that a wildcard \(such as ".foo.com"\) with `BrowserCompatible` matches all subdomains, including "a.b.foo.com".

For more information about these Java classes, see [Package org.apache.http.conn.ssl](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/package-summary.html).



In case *<TrustAll\>* = `TRUE`, the *<HostnameVerifier\>* property is ignored so you can omit it.

> ### Note:  
> You can upload trust store JKS files using the same command as for uploading destination configuration property files. You only need to specify the JKS file instead of the destination configuration file.

> ### Note:  
> Connections to remote services which require *Java Cryptography Extension \(JCE\) unlimited strength jurisdiction policy* are not supported.
