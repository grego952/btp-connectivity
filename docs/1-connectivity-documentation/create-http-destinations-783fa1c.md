## Procedure

1.  Choose *New Destination*.

    > ### Note:  
    > In section **Destination Configuration**, do not change the default tab *Blank Template*, unless you want to create a destination for a specific service instance in a subscription-based scenario. For more information, see [Destinations Pointing to Service Instances](destinations-pointing-to-service-instances-685f383.md).

2.  Enter a destination name.

3.  From the *<Type\>* dropdown menu, choose `HTTP`.

4.  The *<Description\>* field is optional.

5.  Specify the destination URL.

6.  From the *<Proxy Type\>* dropdown box, select `Internet` or `OnPremise`, depending on the connection you need to provide for your application.

    > ### Note:  
    > For more information, see also [HTTP Destinations](http-destinations-42a0e6b.md).

7.  From the *<Authentication\>* dropdown box, select the authentication type you need for the connection.

    For details, see [HTTP Destinations](http-destinations-42a0e6b.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > If you set an `HTTPS` destination, you need to also add a Trust Store. For more information, see [Use Destination Certificates](use-destination-certificates-df1bb55.md).

8.  \(Optional\) If you are using more than one Cloud Connector for your subaccount, you must enter the *<Location ID\>* of the target Cloud Connector.
